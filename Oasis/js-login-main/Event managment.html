			Event management is the application of project management to the creation and development of small and/or large-scale personal or corporate events such as festivals, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or conventions.
			Event managers plan and organise promotional, business and social events. They're responsible for running a range of events, ensuring the target audience is engaged and the message of the event is marketed properly. Events play a huge part in the success of a brand or an organisation.
			In summary, the success of an event is determined by the following five essential event management elements: concept, coordination, control, culmination, and closeout. You can ensure that your event is well-organized, well-executed, and memorable for your attendees by incorporating these elements into your planning.
